<h3>We can't stop writing</h3>

<p>Today I got on the train and wrote 136 characters. I then got to work and wrote somewhere around 10,000 characters. I then got back on the train and wrote 99 characters on Twitter and 151 characters on Facebook. I got in and scribbled a note on the sideboard – I don’t know how many characters that was. I then wrote a couple of emails and then I wrote this, so far it’s 303 characters…</p>

<p>Welcome to generation copy.</p>


<p>We never stop writing, and if it is it’s to start reading. We’re always on standby to share a pithy update with our friends or leave a witty response under somebody’s photo. If we’re lucky, we’ll be rewarded with a little thumbs up.</p>


<p>There’s already been a lot written about society’s increasing reliance on social media. “Is technology reducing pupils’ attention spans?” asks the media. For most 20-50 year olds in developed countries, Facebook, Twitter and Angry Birds are just a couple of touches away. And who can blame them for craving these distractions? If you told me ten years ago that I could access any piece of information I desired  from my Nokia 3310 I think that I might have wet myself.</p>


<p>The media are probably correct:  social media is probably decreasing attention spans and almost definitely encouraging a mindset of instant gratification. Nuts.</p>


<p>But, this social media thing as done some good: it has inspired a whole generation of habitual writers.</p>


<p>Writing (and being read) is no longer  the preserve of the lucky few who mange to get in with a publisher or ad agency. Never has there been a  period in history where the ability to write and to be read has been so easy.</p>


<p>I see genuinely witty, intelligent and funny snippets of copy on a daily basis. Today’s highlight was: “Mrs. Potato Head probably gives Mr. Potato head”. Okay, it’s not Shakespeare, but it features many of the attributes that a great copy does: humour, risk and brevity.</p>


<p>Social media has been blamed for frazzling attention spans, wasting time and promoting self indulgence, but what about the good stuff?</p>


<p>If used thoughtfully and sparingly it is a fantastic place to sharpen your skills and ability to produce short, to-the-point copy; something that takes lots of practice.</p>


<p>So, lookout for this new breed of writer. My guess if they’ll produce some good stuff…unless they get distracted half way throu</p>
