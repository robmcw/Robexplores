			<h2>I don't write words, I sell your product</h2>
			<p> Your looking for a copywriter for your project in London or Bristol, I'm pretty good. 
				I work best online. Be it emails, websites, web applications, I combine a knowledge of how people interact with the web (you might call this user experience), with a marketing background and technical knowhow (I made this very site). 
				but spend a good amount of time in Bristol. 
				

			I'm used to working with designers and developer in agile workflows and am a big adovocate of user testing. After all, what's the point of testing a design without it's content. 

			Why you should hire me: 

			I can slip into your team
			I work to the bigger picture
			</p>
